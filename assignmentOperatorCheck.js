console.log(`2) 0 == "0" is : "${0 == "0"}" because it compares the value from right and left operands 
and the values are same 0==0` )

console.log(`3) 0 == false is : "${0 == false}" because false is represented as 0 and on comparision  0 = 0 is true`);
console.log(``);

console.log(`4) null == undefined is : "${null == undefined}" because by doing "==" they become loosely equal
 and the boolean values of null and undefined is false and result is ==> false == false is "true"`);
 console.log(``);

console.log(`5) 1==[1] : "${1==[1]}" because it just compares the value even if types are different in right
 and left operands the values are same 1==1 and is "true`);

console.log(`6) 0 == true is : "${1 == true}" because true is represented as 1 and on comparision  1 = 1 is true`);
console.log(``);

console.log(`7) 1 == '1' is : "${1 == '1'}" because due to loosey type,it just compares the value from right 
and left operands and the values are same 1==1 and is "true"`);
